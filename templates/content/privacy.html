              It's okay to change your mind upon ordering. Just email us at hola@hookcoffee.com.sg right away if you place a wrong order, for either an exchange or a full refund. For lost parcel or late parcels (defined on the 5th working day after the shipping date), we will either send out a new bag of coffee or provide a full refund of the goods. Refunds will be issued in the same method of payment as the original payment, or in credits.
